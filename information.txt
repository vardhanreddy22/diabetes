Follow the below tips to control the diabetes

Eat healthy

This is crucial when you have diabetes, because what you eat affects your blood sugar.
No foods are strictly off-limits. Focus on eating only as much as your body needs. Get
plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Choose nonfat dairy and lean meats.
Limit foods that are high in sugar and fat. Remember that carbohydrates turn into sugar,
so watch your carb intake. Try to keep it about the same from meal to meal. This is even
more important if you take insulin or drugs to control your blood sugars.

Exercise

If you're not active now, itâ€™s time to start. You don't have to join a gym and do cross-training.
Just walk, ride a bike, or play active video games. Your goal should be 30 minutes of activity
that makes you sweat and breathe a little harder most days of the week. An active lifestyle helps
you control your diabetes by bringing down your blood sugar. It also lowers your chances of getting
heart disease. Plus, it can help you lose extra pounds and ease stress.

Get checkups

See your doctor at least twice a year. Diabetes raises your odds of heart disease. So learn your
numbers: cholesterol, blood pressure, and A1c (average blood sugar over 3 months). Get a full eye
exam every year. Visit a foot doctor to check for problems like foot ulcers and nerve damage.

Manage stress

When you're stressed, your blood sugar levels go up. And when you're anxious, you may not manage your
diabetes well. You may forget to exercise, eat right, or take your medicines. Find ways to relieve stress
through deep breathing, yoga, or hobbies that relax you.
